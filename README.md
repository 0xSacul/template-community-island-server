# Sunflower Land Community Island Server (Template using TypeScript).

This basic template will help you set up your very first custom server to host your own island in Sunflower Land Community Island.

The code has been commented out in as much detail as possible so that anyone can understand it, and technically you don't need to know anything about development to host this server.

An example of how to prepare and host the server is given below.

If you have any questions or requests, please contact Sacul on the official Sunflower Land Discord.

## 👀 Starting the server

Before going wild with commands in your command prompt, please make sure that you have NodeJS installed and ready on your computer.

[Download NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Now that you're ready with NodeJS, you will need to clone this template on your account.

Using the green "Use this template" button on the top of the page you'll be able to clone this template on your account.

For beginners I would recommand using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), the friendly graphical UI is really easy to use for beginners.

### For Development (local)

First, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
    npm install
```

Once done, you can run the server using:

```bash
    npm run start
```

🎉 Congrats, your server is now up and ready for local testing!

## 👾 Hosting your server

To host your server you have multiple ways, either free or paid.

Here I'll give you a quick example to host your server for free using [Railway](https://railway.app/).

Once your server and you are ready, head to Railway and create an account.

Once created and on your Dashboard you'll see your projects board. If it's not already done, create a new project and name it whatever you want.

Now that you're inside your project, have a look on the bottom right corner, see the little purple "+ New" button? Click on it!

Select Github Repo and search for your server repository, click on it and that's it! Railway will automatically install and deploy your server for you!

Well, not that ready, you still need a domain to point your Scene.js to, click on your deployment and head to the settings, scroll down a bit until you find the domains section and click on "Generate Domain". Railway will automatically generate a free domain name for you, and now you are ready!

Have fun ❤️
